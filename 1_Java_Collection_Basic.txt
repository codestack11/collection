Collections Need of Collections Framework
=========================================


1.What is the Need of collection ? 
==================================
 
Array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogenous data element.
The main advantages of array is we can represents multiple values with single variable.
So that resuability of code will be improved.

Limitation of Object Type Array : 
------------------------------

Arrays are fixed in size i.e. once we created an array with fixed size there no chance of increasing or 
decreasing it's size based on our requirement.Hence to use array compulsary we should know the size inadvanced
Which may not possible always.

Array can hold only homogenous data element : 

Student[] s=new Student[1000]
s[0] = new Student;(correct)
s[1] = new Costumer;(wrong)

We can resolve this problem using Object Array : 

Object[] s=new Object[1000]
s[0] = new Student;(correct)
s[1] = new Costumer;(correct)

Arrays concept not implemented based on some standard Data Structure hence readymade method support not available
For every requirement we need to write code explicitly.Which is complexity of programming. 

To over come above limitation of Array we should go for collections 

Collections are growable in Nature. i.e. Based on our requirement we can decrease or increase the size.
collection can holds both Homogenous and Heterogenous data structure.

Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure.Hence ready method support is availavble for every requirement.
Being a programmer we have to use this methods and we are not responsible to provide implentation.


2.Difference between Array and Collections ? 

Arrays
======

1. Arrays are fixed in Size.
2.Wrt to memory Arrays are not recommended to use.
3.Wrt to performance Arrays are  recommended to use.
4.Arrays can hold only homogenous data type elememt.
5.There is no underlying data structure in Arrays So no ready made method support will be there.
6.Array can hold both primitive and object type.

Collections
===========
1.Collections are growable in Nature i.e. Based on our requiremnt we increase or decrease the Size.
2.Wrt to memory Collections are  recommended to use.
3.Wrt to performance Collections are not recommended to use.
4.Collections can hold bothe homogenous and heterogenous elements.
5.Every collections class implemented based on some standard Data Srtucture 
  Hence ready method support is available for every requirement.
6.Collection can hold only object not primitive data types.


Collection  : 
=============

If we want to represent a group of individual object as single entity then we should go for collection.  


Collection Framework :
======================

It defines several classes and interfaces which can be used a group of objects as a single entity.


Difference between Collection and Collections : 
===============================================

Collection is an iterface which can use to represent group of individual object as a single entity.

Collections is an utility class present in Java.util.package to define several utility method 
i.e (Sorting , Searching ....) for collection object.
