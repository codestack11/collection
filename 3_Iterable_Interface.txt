Iterable Interface in Java :
===========================

The Iterable interface was introduced in JDK 1.5. It belongs to java.lang package. 
In general, an object Implementing Iterable allows it to be iterated. An iterable 
interface allows an object to be the target of enhanced for loop(for-each loop). 


Definition of Iterable
======================

public interface Iterable<T>
{
  Iterator<T> iterator();
  
  Spliterator<T> spliterator();

  void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action);
}

Here, T is the type of element returned by the Iterator.

There are three ways in which objects of Iterable can be iterated.

Using enhanced for loop(for-each loop)
Using Iterable forEach loop
Using Iterator<T> interface
