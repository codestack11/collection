List Interface : java.util.list
-------------------------------


* It is the child interface of collection.
* List contains the order element.
* May includes duplicates.
* Support the index based search,random access but element can be easily inserted
  irrepective of the position. 
* If we want to represent a group of individual object as asingle entity where 
  duplicates are allowed and insertion order must be preserved then we should 
  go for List.
* We can differentiate duplicates by using index.
* We can preserve insertion order using index,hence index play a very important role in 
  list interface.
* Multiple null elements can be stored.  
* Elements by their position can be accessed.
* List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.
* Through the ListIterator, we can iterate the list in forward and backward directions.
